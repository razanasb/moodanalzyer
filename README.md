# Mental Health Mood Analyzer
## Project Description: 
This project analyze the mood from text input by the user.

## Why This Idea?
The idea is to help people quickly understand their emotional state from their own text. It can be a helpful tool for mental health awareness.

## Why This Model?
I chose the distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english model because it's designed for sentiment analysis, offering a balance between accuracy and performance, suitable for real-time applications.

## Model Details
Model Link: https://huggingface.co/distilbert/distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english
Model Type: DistilBERT is a streamlined version of BERT, designed to perform well while being computationally efficient.

## The Code:

## Limitations:
- The model i used is pretty good but sometimes it doesn't catch the complex feelings well, so it might get the mood wrong.

- It's trained on English texts mostly, so it might not get things right with other languages or specific ways people talk.

- The tips it gives based on your mood are very basic and might not fit everyone or every situation.

## Challenges:
**Model Limitations:** The model does well for simple sentiments but may not fully capture complex emotional moods.

## Next Steps:
Future improvements might include using more advanced models for better emotional understanding or creating a custom model for specific text types. Adding arabic version.
